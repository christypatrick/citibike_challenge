# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

## Summary:
The Citi Bike Analytics assignment examines the impact on bike rentals in 2020 due to Covid-19, also known as the Coronavirus.  The timeframe for this analysis compares Summer 2019 bike rentals to Summer 2020 bike rentals. In 2020, a majority of the country implemented some form of lock-down procedure and many people that typically work in an office setting resorted to working from home.  How has the virus and subsequent lockdown impacted the number of rentals during an otherwise popular time of year in one of the most populated cities in America?

## Map Visualizations 
To begin, all starting stations have been plotted on a map of New York City with the markers sized and colored based on the number of rentals in the summer of 2020.  Similarly, a map was created with all ending stations with the markers sized and colored based on the number of rentals in the summer of 2020.  The starting stations map indicates that a majority of rentals occured from Midtown Manhattan to Lower Manhattan.  The most popular starting location is 12th Ave & W 40th Street with 39,243 rentals in the summer of 2020.  The ending stations map also indicates that a majority of rental stops occured from Midtown Manhattan to Lower Manhattan.  The most popular starting location is 12th Ave & W 40th Street with 39,539 rentals in the summer of 2020.    

To examine the impact of Covid on the most popular locations, two street view maps were generated to examine the top 5 stations with the highest number of rentals.  In 2019, three of the most popular stations were located inland just south of midtown while two stations were located along the western coast.  In 2020, three of the top five stations were located along the mid to lower west side and one located on the southwestern corner of Central Park.  Based on this data, it appears that the most popular rental locations in 2019 were near office buildings and residential areas while in 2020 the most popular rental locations were near recreational areas and not concentrated in the office and residentials areas.
